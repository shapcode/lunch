# Lunch Finder

Lunch Finder is a simple Android application sample showcasing both View-based and Compose-based
implementations of a basic nearby restaurant locator. The app uses the Google Places API to find
restaurants which are nearby and offers the ability to search for restaurants by keyword.

As a simple sample, there are only three screens:
* Restaurant List - Shows a list of restaurants
* Restaurant Map - Shows the restaurants as pins on a map
* Restaurant Detail - Shows basic information about the restaurant
